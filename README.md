## Reflection

Through refactoring our application to use React Router, we encountered some implementation issues. However, once we had Router working, it became clear how much easier it is to perform conditional rendering using this tool. After spending time writing applications using vanilla JS, we feel extremely grateful for the work that has gone into building React. This tool makes writing web apps much more streamlined.
